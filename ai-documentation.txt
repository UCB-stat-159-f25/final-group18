Sydney(Seungwon) - ChatGPT 5.2: 

I used an AI assistant to understand the MyST build workflow and resolve Git merge issues related to generated build files. The AI provided guidance on which files are auto-generated, how to properly complete an unfinished merge, and how to maintain a clean repository structure, which helped us finalize the documentation build successfully.

Inputs to the AI

- The inputs provided to the AI assistant included:
- Error messages and terminal outputs related to myst build
- Repository structure (e.g., presence of _build/, pdf_builds/, and source notebooks)
- Git status outputs indicating an unfinished merge state
- Questions about whether MyST-generated files should be committed
- Screenshots or logs showing merge conflicts involving build artifacts

Outputs from the AI

- The AI assistant provided:
- Conceptual explanations of the MyST build process and its generated artifacts
- Clarification on which directories are auto-generated and should not be manually edited
- Guidance on best practices for handling MyST build outputs in version control
- Step-by-step instructions to properly conclude a Git merge after resolving conflicts
- Recommendations for maintaining a clean and reproducible documentation workflo

Demi - ChatGPT 5.2: 

I used ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking mode to help generate doc strings for the functions, as well as providing an standardized format of naming outputs and figures. I also used it to resolve the ERROR occur when running pytest -q.

Inputs to the AI

1. Functions in model_utils.py. Prompt: Help me write the doc string for these functions,  describing the purpose of the function, their inputs and types, and their outputs. Write cleanly with minimal wording.
2. Screen shot of terminal 1, showing "ERROR collecting utils/tests/test_utils.py".

Outpus from the AI

1. Doc strings embedded in the functions, current version shown in model_utils.py
2. Suggestion of adding conftest.py, with code provided
